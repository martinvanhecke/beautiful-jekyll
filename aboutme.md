### About me

<div style="text-align: justify">
I am  a final year PhD. student at Leiden University. The topic of my research is "*Evolutionary Algorithms designing Responsive Metamaterials*". My research made me realize the almost magical capability of computing as a 
great problem solving tool. The developed interest grew rapidly when I discovered how computing allows machines to learn intelligence through mathematical models: the world of artifical intelligence. Ever so intrigued, this blog is an attempt to give back 
to the generosity of so many folks on the Internet.
